# [awbn/docker-gyb](https://github.com/awbn/docker-gyb)
A containerized version of [Got Your Back](https://github.com/jay0lee/got-your-back) to make it easy to back up your Gmail account. Can run standalone or as  full/incremental cron jobs (default).

## Supported architectures
This is a multiarch image which supports `linux/amd64`,`linux/arm64`, and `linux/arm/v7`.

## Tags
Tags correspond with [Got Your Back releases](https://github.com/jay0lee/got-your-back/releases)

## Usage
[GYB](https://github.com/jay0lee/got-your-back) requires some bootstrapping to create a new project before you can run. For complete bootstrapping steps, see the [GYB Wiki](https://github.com/jay0lee/got-your-back/wiki#running-gyb-for-the-first-time).

### First Run
`docker run -it -e EMAIL=example@gmail.com -e NOCRON=1 -v ${PWD}/config:/config awbn/gyb /app/gyb --action create-project` and follow the prompts. See [Bootstrapping Notes](#bootstrapping-notes) below for an abbreviated set of steps.

Once you've created the project and cached the credentials, you can run the container to start the background cron jobs. Make sure that you mount the same volume so that the credentials are re-used.

### First backup
The first full backup will (likely) take a long time. It's recommend to do this as a one-off run: 
`docker run -it -e EMAIL=example@gmail.com -e NOCRON=1 -v ${PWD}/config:/config awbn/gyb /app/gyb --action backup`

### Backups
By default you should start the container in detached mode and let it run incremental and full backups. See the docker-compose or CLI examples below.

#### Docker compose
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  got-your-back:
    image: awbn/gyb
    container_name: got-your-back
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - EMAIL=example@gmail.com
      - TZ=America/Los_Angeles
    volumes:
      - <path to data>:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

#### CLI
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=got-your-back \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e EMAIL=example@gmail.com \
  -e TZ=America/Los_Angeles \
  -v <path to data>:/config \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  awbn/gyb
```

### Restoring from backup
See [GYB's wiki](https://github.com/jay0lee/got-your-back/wiki#performing-a-restore) for information on how to restore from a backup. Running the command in a container might look like: `docker run -it -e EMAIL=example@gmail.com -e NOCRON=1 -v ${PWD}/config:/config awbn/gyb /app/gyb --action restore`.

Note that you must have given the OAuth token 'write' permissions to your gmail account during bootstrapping for restore to work. If you didn't, you can delete the `<email>.cfg` file from the `/config` volume to force GYB to prompt for a new token.

## Advanced Usage
This container is based on [LinuxServer.io](https://linuxserver.io)'s Alpine base image. This means you can take advantage of all the LSIO goodness, including regular base image updates, user/group identification, loading environment variables from files (docker secrets), etc. See the [LSIO docs](https://docs.linuxserver.io) for more info.

### Getting notified of failures
This container can be configured to send you an email if your cron job(s) fail. To do so, you'll need to pass in the `MAIL_TO`, `MAIL_FROM`, `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, and, optionally, the `SMTP_TLS` env variables.

### Customizing the jobs
By default the container has two jobs which are run on a regular schedule. The 'Full' job runs at 1am every Sunday (timezone depends on the container's TZ) and does a full backup. The incremental job runs at 1am Monday-Saturday and does a partial backup using GYB's [`--search` parameter](https://github.com/jay0lee/got-your-back/wiki#improving-backup-speed-incremental-daily-backups). You can customize the timing of these jobs and the GYB command which is run using environment variables. You can also define your own custom job as well.

To run the full job at a different schedule, set the `JOB_FULL_CRON` env variable to [valid cron syntax](https://crontab.guru). To run a different command for that job (e.g., to include only a particular label), set the `JOB_FULL_CMD` env variable to `/app/gyb <valid gyb command>`. See the [GYB Wiki](https://github.com/jay0lee/got-your-back/wiki) for more info on valid GYB commands.

In addition to the `JOB_FULL_` job, there are also the `JOB_INC_` and `JOB_EXTRA_` jobs. By default, the extra job is not used, but could be used to, e.g., back up a particular label more often. See the [Parameters](#parameters) section for more details.

## Bootstrapping Notes
See the [GYB Wiki](https://github.com/jay0lee/got-your-back/wiki#running-gyb-for-the-first-time) for authoritative steps. These are some rough notes:

- Run `docker run -it -e EMAIL=example@gmail.com -e NOCRON=1 -v ${PWD}/config:/config awbn/gyb /app/gyb --action create-project` and open the URL provided in the console
- Give access to GAM and paste the token into console
- Open the URL provided
- Configure the OAuth consent screen:
  - 'External' (if you're not using a gmail account that's part of a workspace)
  - 'App Name': GYB Docker (or whatever you want)
  - 'Support Email' and 'Developer Contact': your contact email
  - 'Scopes': none
  - 'Test users': Email addresses of the users you want to backup
- In the Google cloud console, click 'Credentials' -> 'Create Credential' -> 'OAuth client ID':
  - 'Application Type': Desktop App
  - 'Name': GYB (or anything)
- Run `docker run -it -e EMAIL=example@gmail.com -e NOCRON=1 -v ${PWD}/config:/config awbn/gyb /app/gyb --action --action estimate --search "newer_than:7d"`
  - Select Scopes (Recommended: 1,5 for read-only backups)
  - Visit provided URL and paste token into the console. At this point the credentials should be fully saved and the service account authorized
